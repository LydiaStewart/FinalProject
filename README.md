## Welcome!
I love reading, and I wanted to make a website for other book lovers! I used Google Books API for this React project.
The site's homepage displays the newest books in various genres.

Everything is a link! Clicking on the genre will take you to a larger list, clicking an author's name will show you everything they've written, and of course, clicking on an item will bring you a page of the book's details.

If you have a particular book in mind, you can use the search. You can also type a genre, key-word, or author, and it will generate a list for you. Users can also search for their friends, follow them, and see the books in their lists.

On the details page, you can add a book to your favorites, your read list, or your to-read list, which will update your profile (users can sign in with auth0). 
Also, for the books that are available as e-books, there is a link provided for purchasing.

## Happy reading!
